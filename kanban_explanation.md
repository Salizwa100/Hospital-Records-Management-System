# About Kanban Board

A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that:

1. Uses columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) to represent workflow stages.
2. The workflow stages are represented by the columns defined in the project such as To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.
3. Provides real-time transparency of tasks.
4. Provides clear roles and responsibilities of each team member.
5. Provides better capacity planning â€“ clear visibility prevents overloading team members and identifies potential bottlenecks.
6. Above all, the workflow stages are designed to support Agile principles.

## How My Kanban Board Addressed the Following:

### Visualizing Workflow
- My board consists of 7 columns that group the tasks per stage/status: **Backlog, In Review, On Hold, Ready, In Progress, Testing, and Done**.
- Tasks move left to right as they progress, making it easy to track status and priority at a glance.

### Limiting Work-in-Progress (WIP)
- The **In Progress** column is limited to a small number of tasks to ensure focused work.
- The **Ready** column consists of tasks that are next in line once the team members have the capacity to start work on them.
- The **On Hold** column provides visibility of blocked and unblocked tasks that are part of the actual in-progress work.
- The combination of the above ensures that team members are not overloaded and helps identify bottlenecks early.

### Supporting Agile Principles
- Full team work transparency for tasks **In Progress** vs **Ready** vs **On Hold**.
- The **Review** stage allows us to gather stakeholder feedback.
- By limiting **In Progress** tasks, we allow for continuous delivery in small batches.
- The priority of the tasks in the **Backlog** stage can be changed as per stakeholder needs.
- The **Testing** stage allows stakeholders to verify system functionality. If requirements are not met, the task is moved back to the **Backlog** or **In Progress** stage.
