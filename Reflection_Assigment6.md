### Challenges in Agile Planning
- **Aligning Stakeholder Needs:** Balancing security requirements (user authorizations, compliance) with user experience such as fast access to records was a challenge.
- **Effort Estimation Complexity:** The integrating components such as the insurance provider system and lab systems required cross-team coordination, making estimation tricky.
- **Handling Dependencies:** Some key processes like prescriptions depended on the doctorâ€™s ability to submit them digitally, requiring careful sprint prioritization.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Ensuring that the system implemented can handle growing patient records without affecting speed and reliability required extra planning.

### Lessons Learned
- Stakeholder requirements priorities must be aligned early to avoid conflicts and confusion during the sprint execution.
- Breaking down tasks into smaller portions allows for better sprint flexibility, shared workload, and risk management.
- Testing must be integrated within sprints to ensure processes developed are meeting the stakeholder requirements.
- Automate repetitive processes, such as appointment reminders and lab result updates, to improve efficiency.
