## My Kanban Board Customizing choices:

### Added "On hold" Column
To better track tasks that are temporarily paused due to dependencies or other issues, we have introduced an **"On hold"** column. Reason/ Benefits:   
- Visualize blocked items that still require attention.
- Identify dependencies that need resolution.
- Facilitate discussions on tackling blockers during daily standup meetings.

### Added "Testing" Column
To ensure the system meets functional, performance, design, and implementation requirements as outlined in the blueprint and stakeholder requirements list, we have added a **"Testing"** column. Reason/ Benefits:
- Allow verification of system compliance with requirements.
- Help categorize defects or issues for better tracking.
- Enable breaking down logged defects into smaller tasks.
- Assist in assigning issues to the relevant team members for resolution.
