## My Kanban Board Customizing choices:

### Added "On hold" Column
To better track tasks that are temporarily paused due to dependencies or other issues, we have introduced an **"On hold"** column. Reason/ Benefits:   
- Visualize blocked items that still require attention.
- Identify dependencies that need resolution.
- Facilitate discussions on tackling blockers during daily standup meetings.

### Added "Testing" Column
To ensure the system meets functional, performance, design, and implementation requirements as outlined in the blueprint and stakeholder requirements list, we have added a **"Testing"** column. Reason/ Benefits:
- Allow verification of system compliance with requirements.
- Help categorize defects or issues for better tracking.
- Enable breaking down logged defects into smaller tasks.
- Assist in assigning issues to the relevant team members for resolution.

## **Task 1: Class implementations Source Code** '([Class implementations src folder](https://github.com/Salizwa100/Hospital-Records-Management-System/tree/main/src))'

# Design choice:

## ðŸ“Œ Why Python?

Python was chosen for this project due to its:

- **Simplicity and readability** â€“ great for collaboration and maintenance.
- **Rich libraries** â€“ such as `datetime` for handling time-based data.
- **Object-oriented design** â€“ perfect for modeling real-world entities like doctors, patients, and appointments.
- **Rapid prototyping** â€“ allows for faster development cycles with fewer lines of code.

## Overview of Modules

This system is composed of three main Python files:

### 1. `users.py` â€“ User Roles and Permissions
Defines core users and their specific responsibilities:

- **SystemUser** â€“ A base class with login, logout, and password management features.
- **Doctor, Nurse, AdminStaff, Patient** â€“ Inherit from `SystemUser` or standalone, each with domain-specific methods.

#### Example:
```python
doctor.prescribe_treatment("patient123", "Paracetamol 500mg")
```
This lets a doctor issue a prescription for a patient.
##

### 2. `entities.py` â€“ Core Data Models
Encapsulates entities such as:

- **Appointment** â€“ Handles scheduling between doctors and patients.
- **MedicalRecord** â€“ Stores diagnosis, treatment, and date of entry.
- **Bill** â€“ Tracks billing details with methods for payment, claim submission, and viewing.

#### Example:
```python
bill.pay_bill()
```
Changes bill status and confirms payment.
##

### 3. `lab_system.py` â€“ Lab Integration
Represents interactions between doctors, patients, and lab results.

- **LabSystem** â€“ Allows linking and sending results securely to medical records.

#### Example:
```python
lab_system.send_results()
```
Updates result status and logs the action.

##
## Key Design Decisions

### âœ… Object-Oriented Design
Every major component (like users, bills, appointments) is modeled as a class to mirror real-world entities.

### âœ… Inheritance
Shared functionality (like authentication) is implemented in a base `SystemUser` class and extended in specialized roles like `Doctor` and `Patient`.

### âœ… Encapsulation
User details and operations (e.g., passwords) are kept private (`_password`) to protect data integrity.

### âœ… Simple Role-Based Methods
Each class includes intuitive methods specific to the role:
- `Doctor.diagnose_patient()`
- `AdminStaff.register_patient_visit()`
- `Patient.make_payment()`

# Design Pattern Justification

This project demonstrates a Hospital Management System using several design patterns to improve modularity, scalability, and maintainability.


## 1. Factory Pattern

**Used in:** `factory/user_factory.py`, `factory/patient_factory.py`

**Justification:** The Factory Pattern is used to encapsulate the object creation process for various system users and patients. It allows the client code to create objects without knowing the exact class name.

**Example:**
```python
UserFactory.create_user("Doctor", name="Dr. Smith", department="Cardiology")
```
Here, based on the type "Doctor", the factory creates and returns a `Doctor` object.

##

## 2. Abstract Factory Pattern

**Used in:** `abstract_factory/medical_team_factory.py`

**Justification:** The Abstract Factory Pattern is used to produce families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

**Example:**
```python
factory = MedicalTeamFactory()
doctor = factory.create_doctor()
nurse = factory.create_nurse()
```
This allows grouping the creation of objects like Doctor and Nurse together for consistent team setups.

##

## 3. Builder Pattern

**Used in:** `builder/patient_builder.py`

**Justification:** The Builder Pattern simplifies the construction of complex objects like a `Patient` with many optional parameters.

**Example:**
```python
patient = PatientBuilder().set_name("John").set_age(30).set_diagnosis("Flu").build()
```
This approach provides a clear and readable way to instantiate objects with various configurations.    

 ##  

## 4. Prototype Pattern

**Used in:** `prototype/bill_prototype.py`

**Justification:** The Prototype Pattern is used to clone existing objects efficiently. This is helpful in billing systems where a similar bill structure is reused.

**Example:**
```python
bill_copy = original_bill.clone()
```
A new bill is created as a copy of an existing one, preserving common attributes.    

##
## 5. Singleton Pattern

**Used in:** `singleton/hospital_registry.py`

**Justification:** The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

**Example:**
```python
registry1 = HospitalRegistry.get_instance()
registry2 = HospitalRegistry.get_instance()
```
Both `registry1` and `registry2` point to the same instance, maintaining a consistent registry across the application.

##

## Conclusion

Using these design patterns, the system architecture remains robust, flexible, and easy to maintain. Each pattern plays a role in reducing tight coupling and improving code clarity and reusability.

# **Assignment 11**

## **Task 1: Repository Interface Design** '([Repositories directory](https://github.com/Salizwa100/Hospital-Records-Management-System/tree/main/repositories))'

# Repository Interface Design - Justification

##

## Why We Used a Generic Repository Interface

- To avoid writing duplicate CRUD methods (`save`, `findById`, `findAll`, `delete`) for every entity.
- By using a generic interface `Repository<T, ID>`, we can define these methods once and reuse them across all models like Patient, Appointment, Invoice, etc.

##

## Benefits of the Design

âœ… **Reusability**:  
  - One interface, multiple implementations.
  - Reduces code duplication for each new entity.

âœ… **Flexibility**:  
  - Easy to swap storage backends (In-Memory, Database, Filesystem) without changing the business logic.

âœ… **Consistency**:  
  - All repositories follow the same method signatures, making the system predictable and easier to maintain.

âœ… **Future-Proofing**:  
  - Adding a new entity (e.g., "Pharmacy") only needs a small new repository that extends the generic interface â€” no need to redesign the whole system.

##

## Quick Example

- `PatientRepository` extends `Repository<Patient, str>`
- `AppointmentRepository` extends `Repository<Appointment, str>`

Both automatically get standard CRUD methods.

##

# Final Summary

- **Generic Repository Pattern** = Cleaner Code + Easier Testing + Ready for future extensions

# Design Decision: Factory Pattern vs Dependency Injection (DI)

##

## Why Factory Pattern was Chosen

In this Hospital Management Repository Layer project, we used the **Factory Pattern** instead of full **Dependency Injection (DI)** to instantiate repositories dynamically.

The key reasons for choosing the Factory Pattern are:

### 1. Simplicity and Focus

- Factory keeps the system simple for now.
- It hides the complexity of storage backend creation from the services.
- Developers do not have to manage dependency injection frameworks manually.
- Clean and lightweight, ideal for this scale of project.

### 2. Flexibility for Future Backends

- `RepositoryFactory` can easily be extended to return:
  - In-Memory repositories (for testing)
  - Database-backed repositories (for production)
  - Filesystem repositories (for backups)

- Switching storage type only requires a small change inside the Factory, **no changes** needed in the service or business logic layers.

### 3. Avoid Early Overhead

- Dependency Injection frameworks (like `injector`, `FastAPI Depends`, `Spring`, etc.) are powerful but heavy.
- DI makes sense for very large-scale systems but would **overcomplicate** this project unnecessarily.

### 4. Centralized Control

- Using a single `RepositoryFactory` provides **central control** over storage selection.
- It acts as the "brain" deciding whether we work with in-memory data, database data, or even external APIs later.
- This minimizes maintenance overhead.
